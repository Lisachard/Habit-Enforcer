## Welcome to our Habit Enforcer Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our object-oriented programming (OOP) lessons in PHP, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of an inspired Habitica website. 🏗️

The goal of our website is quite simple : users create one habit per day in a group with other members and have to check it to fulfill it. It then earns points to the party or remove it if the habit is not checked by the end of the chosen periodicity.  


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

• Account : 
    ◦ Register
    ◦ Login
    ◦ Modify profile
    ◦ Log out

• Group :
    ◦ Create a party
    ◦ Invite members
    ◦ Join a party
    ◦ Look out for group ranking

• Habit : 
    ◦ Create one activity per day
    ◦ Specify its name, periodicity, difficulty, color
    ◦ Check activity's fulfillment
    ◦ Add point to the group
    ◦ Remove point to the group


# User Experience (UX) : 

We choose to make an UX oriented approach. Likewise, you will find the wireframes of the website's main pages and its tree structure linked to the rendering of our project.

# Instructions and Keys :

- Then, launch UnityHub and open new Project with the Tetris unzipped folder. 
- Install the compatible version of Unity.
- You should now be able to open the project and click on the Tetris scene.
- And... click on the play sign to run the game !

You should also keep in mind to use the directional arrows of your keyboard to move the different tetrominos scrolling down : 
- ➡️ allows the player to slide the tetramino to the right of the game screen
- ⬅️ allows the player to slide the tetramino to the left of the game screen
- ⬇️ allows the player to accelerate the fall of the tetramino on the game screen
- `Space bar` allows the player to rotate the tetramino clockwise

Is everything clear ? Alright ! 🎉

Final step... Enjoy ! 😄
