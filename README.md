## Welcome to our Habit Enforcer Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our object-oriented programming (OOP) lessons in PHP, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of an inspired Habitica website. 🏗️

The goal of our website is quite simple : users create one habit per day in a group with other members and have to check it to fulfill it. It then earns points to the party or removes it if the habit is not checked by the end of the chosen period. ✔️  


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

- Account : 
    - Register
    - Login
    - Modify profile
    - Log out

- Group :
    - Create a party
    - Invite members to a party
    - Join a party
    - Look out for groups ranking

- Habit : 
    - Create one activity per day
    - Specify its name, periodicity, difficulty, color
    - Check activity's fulfillment
    - Add point to the group
    - Remove point to the group

- Credits : 
    - Actknowledge writers and their code's property

- Error 404 : 
    - Redirect the user if they are lost in their exploration


# User Experience (UX) : 

We choose to make an UX oriented approach. Likewise, you will find the wireframes of the website's main pages and its tree structure linked to the rendering of our project.

The command `cd assets/img/UX` also gives you access to :
- `Home.png`
