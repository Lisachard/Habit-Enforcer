## Welcome to our Habit Enforcer Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our object-oriented programming (OOP) lessons in PHP, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of an inspired Habitica website. We started with two major tools : a provided code which served as the basis of our project as well as the game oriented software named Unity. 🏗️

The role of our website is quite simple : users to make complete lines by moving pieces of different shapes named tetrominos which scroll from the top to the bottom of the screen. The completed rows then disappear while earning points and the player can fill in the freed squares again. 🕹️


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

• Account : 
    - Register
    - Login
    - Modify profile
    - Log out

• Group :
    - Create a party
    - Invite members
    - Join a party
    - Look out for group ranking

• Habit : 
    - Create one activity per day
    - Specify its name, periodicity, difficulty, color
    - Check activity's fulfillment
    - Add point to the group
    - Remove point to the group

# Instructions and Keys : 

- First, download and unzip `Tetris.zip`.
- Then, launch UnityHub and open new Project with the Tetris unzipped folder. 
- Install the compatible version of Unity.
- You should now be able to open the project and click on the Tetris scene.
- And... click on the play sign to run the game !

You should also keep in mind to use the directional arrows of your keyboard to move the different tetrominos scrolling down : 
- ➡️ allows the player to slide the tetramino to the right of the game screen
- ⬅️ allows the player to slide the tetramino to the left of the game screen
- ⬇️ allows the player to accelerate the fall of the tetramino on the game screen
- `Space bar` allows the player to rotate the tetramino clockwise

Is everything clear ? Alright ! 🎉

Final step... Enjoy ! 😄
